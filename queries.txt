1. What are the most popular three articles of all time 

select count(*) as num,articles.title,path,articles.slug,name,authors.id,status from log,articles,authors group by path,articles.slug,name,authors.id,articles.author,log.status,articles.title having articles.slug = substr(log.path,10) and authors.id=articles.author order by num desc



2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time





select foo.name,sum(foo.num) as total from (select count(*) as num,path,articles.slug,name,authors.id from log,articles,authors group by path,articles.slug,name,authors.id,articles.author having articles.slug = substr(log.path,10) and authors.id=articles.author order by authors.id) as foo group by foo.name order by total desc ;
----------------
select foo.name,sum(foo.num) as total,foo.id from (select count(*) as num,path,articles.slug,name,authors.id from log,articles,authors group by path,articles.slug,name,authors.id,articles.author,log.status having articles.slug = substr(log.path,10) and authors.id=articles.author and log.status like '%200%' order by authors.id) as foo group by foo.id,foo.name order by total desc;
3. 
select foo.abc,foo.num,count(foo.num),log.status,date_trunc('day',log.time) from log, (select count(*) as num,date_trunc('day',time) as abc from log group by date_trunc('day',time) ) as foo
group by foo.abc,foo.num,log.status,date_trunc('day',log.time) having log.status like '%404%' and date_trunc('day',log.time) = foo.abc;


4.select foo.abc,foo.num,count(foo.num) as count ,log.status,date_trunc('day',log.time), (count(foo.num) * 100 / foo.num ) as per from log, (select count(*) as num,date_trunc('day',time) as abc from log group by date_trunc('day',time) ) as foo
group by foo.abc,foo.num,log.status,date_trunc('day',log.time) having log.status like '%404%' and date_trunc('day',log.time) = foo.abc and (count(foo.num) * 100/foo.num) > 1 ;
